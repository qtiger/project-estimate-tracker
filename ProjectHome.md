# Introduction #
**Project Estimate Tracker (PET)** from [shadowfax.org.uk](http://shadowfax.org.uk/wiki/Project_Estimate_Tracker) is designed to allow teams to track progress and time spent on projects. It allows team members to set up new Projects and Tasks, and record estimates of task completion. As the project moves on completion estimates may be revised to reflect changes/delays etc. PET also contains a time-sheet component which allows team members to record time spent against tasks.

# Technology #
PET is built using PHP, Javascript and MySQL for use within an intranet style environment. The front-end is accessible via a web browser. AJAX controls are used for certain functions. The aim is to make the time-tracking interface as easy to use for the end-user as possible.

# History #
PET has been in use since 2008 with a small project team. The time-sheet facility was added in March 2010. Whilst there are a number of known limitations (detailed on the [Limitations and Issues page](LimitationsAndIssues.md)) it is a stable product. The relatively low version number because in its early development years (prior to v0.1.0 PET) was released without version numbers. PET was publically released with a GPL v3 license in Oct 2011
