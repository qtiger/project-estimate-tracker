#summary What is in the pipeline?

= Database Hardening =

Work has is now under-way to revisit every user entry form and review the way that user input is handled in order to improve the database & server security. As part of this it is hoped to rationalise the way that SQL calls are made and reduce the amount of duplicated code dealing with results sets.

Additionally as part of this step error messages which were returned by the scripts are being moved to a central messages file to make automated testing and localisation easier.

= User Security =

Once the data hardening has been done, it is intended to add proper user security to force a user-name & password to be required in order to view/update PET. At this stage I may also review whether to have role levels (eg normal user who can only edit their own items and supervisor who can edit all). Ideally it would also be good to link with any existing login systems (eg OpenID, LDAP etc), but this is much less likely.

= Template Review =

PET is the only project I've ever done with Smarty. As such the way that the templates have been constructed is a bit convoluted. It would be nice to simplify them either within Smarty, or move to a much lighter model using pure PHP templates, which has been my preferred approach on subsequent projects.
