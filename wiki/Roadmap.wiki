= v0.2.0 Database Hardening =

Work has is now well under-way to revisit every user entry form and review the way that user input is handled in order to improve the database & server security. This includes

* Rationalisation of the way SQL calls are handled
* Remove reliance on cookies for storing login data
* Tighter validation of form and query string data
* Robust treatment of special characters in put data (both to ensure correct display and to increase security)
* Creation of central messages file to improve ease of localisation
* Optimisation of certain inefficient code routines

= v0.3.0 User Security =

Once the data hardening has been done, it is intended to add proper user security to force a user-name & password to be required in order to view/update PET. At this stage I may also review whether to have role levels (eg normal user who can only edit their own items and supervisor who can edit all). Ideally it would also be good to link with any existing login systems (eg OpenID, LDAP etc), but this is much less likely to happen, unless specific requests are made for it.

= Template Review =

PET is the only project I've ever done with Smarty. As such the way that the templates have been constructed is a bit convoluted. It would be nice to simplify them either within Smarty, or move to a much lighter model using pure PHP templates, which has been my preferred approach on subsequent projects.
