= Introduction =

The following steps take you through how to install PET on your server. I hope in the next few weeks to have a download package to make this process a little easier.

= Requirements =
In order to run PET you will need a server or PC with
 * Apache installed
 * MySQL Installed
 * A fixed IP address (at least locally)

You will also need access to a MySQL administrator account on the server. If you are using a standalone PC to act as the PET Server, a packaged installation of Apache, MySQL and PHP (for example XAMPP) may be used.

= Setting up the database =
 * From the MySQL administrator account open and run the script *database_setup.sql*. This will create all of the required tables and the basic lookup data
 * Create a user account for the 'PET' database, and grant them select, insert, update and delete privileges on the PET database
 * Modify the *environment.php* file with the username and password of the database user

*Note*. If you want to install multiple instances of PET, or change the database name you will need to search and replace all instances of PET in the *database_setup.sql* file, and change the database name in *environment.php* 

= Setting up Smarty =
PET uses a PHP Template Engine called [http://www.smarty.net/ Smarty]. Smarty's library files need to be installed under the web-root of your Apache server, and the $smartyPath variable in the *smarty_init.php* needs to point to the installation location of Smarty.

Smarty also needs several directories inside the PET folder. By default these are
 * taskmon_templates/templates
 * taskmon_templates/templates_c
 * taskmon_templates/cache
 * taskmon_templates/configs

= Installing the PET files =
All of the files from the PET trunk folder need to be installed under the web-root of your Apache server. The normal approach would be to put these in a folder called PET.

All of the templates from the trunk\templates folder need to be placed in the smarty templates folder (by default taskmon_templates/templates)

Once these files are installed you are ready to start

=Setting up the browser to connect to PET=
In order for the browser to connect to PET it needs a URL. The simplest form of this is the IP address of the server followed by the directory name of PET (eg 192.0.0.10/PET). However, to make things tidier a full URL should be specified. If you are using a conventional Apache installation you can specify this in the Apache configuration files.

If you are using a local installation (for example on XAMPP) you can specify this on the client machines, by altering the *hosts* file.

=Logging in for the first time=
Type in the URL you set  up in the previous stage into the URL bar of your browser. If the set-up worked successfully you should see the PET login window.

For the first time you may login with the username *zzz*. This is the general user - and will allow you to set-up all of the other users needed.
